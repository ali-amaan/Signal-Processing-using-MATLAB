% Return figures from the both cases (pole-zero plot and magnitude response).
% Write down the filter coefficients of your filter H(z) = B(z)/A(z) =...,
% which you can get by clicking the icon [b,a] in the top row.

%% Task a) 
% create a lowpass filter with the sampling frequency fs = 16000 Hz.
% Let the cut-off frequency (passband/stopband) be fc = 4000 Hz.
% Implement both FIR (only zeros) and IIR (both zeros and poles) filter.


%% Task b)
% Create a 8th order IIR bandpass filter with fs = 26000 where passband is 
% 3400 . . . 4500 Hz.
